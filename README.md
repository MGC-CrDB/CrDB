# CrDB
Repository for the CreateDesignerDatabook Utility

It used to be CreateDxDatabook (and is still called by that name in the Mentor Automation and Scripting Community) 
The DxDatabook Addin for Designer (the schematic capture tool for the Xpedition/PadsPro/Netlist flows) is now called Databook, 
so the utility should rightly be called CrDatabook or CrDB 
Anyway - Here is the link to the Automation and Scripting Commnuty, where you can see more about the details about the utility :

As time permits, I am going to try to grab the documents and discusions in the A&S Community and put a copy here...
